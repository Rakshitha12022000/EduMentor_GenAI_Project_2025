# EduMentor

**Your AI-Powered Personalized Learning Assistant**

---

## Overview

**EduMentor** is an AI-powered educational assistant built to transform how students learn and how educators support them. Combining OpenAI's GPT models, Streamlit, and SerpAPI, EduMentor delivers adaptive quizzes, personalized learning paths, and real-time analytics. 

---

## Business Problem

It directly tackles a critical gap in education ‚Äî *students often don't know where to begin or how to progress*. Instead of leaving learners to random trial-and-error, EduMentor provides clear starting points, personalized guidance, and live progress tracking, driving focused, measurable, and faster growth.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/edumentor.git
cd edumentor
```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. **Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file and add:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

5. **Create a `serviceAccountKey.json` file**

Create the key at [link](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

After creating the key, rename it to serviceAccountKey add the json file to a new firebase folder in the streamlit_ui folder. 

Update the **credentitals.Certficate** with your key filename in the line: "firebase/<your_file_name>.json".

```python
# firestore_db.py 

if not firebase_admin._apps:
    cred = credentials.Certificate(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "firebase/edumentor-77688-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-2d32c0d42b.json"))
    firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
```

6. **Note for Running Locally (Windows/Mac users)**

When making API requests to the backend in Mac, replace `localhost` with `127.0.0.1` in the URL inside `main.py`:

```python
# main.py (line inside Adaptive Quiz page)
response = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/generate-quiz",
    json={"topics": selected_topics, "difficulty": random.choice(["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"]), "num_questions": 10}
)
```

7. **Run the Application**
```bash
python run.py
streamlit run streamlit_ui/main.py (In another terminal)
```

## LLM Utilisation

- Adaptive Quiz Generation:
    - GPT-4 models were prompted to generate questions at multiple difficulty levels for user-selected topics.
- Personalized Learning Paths: 
    - LLMs generated prerequisite topic lists, importance scores, and detailed explanations for each weak topic provided by users.
    - LLMs helped in suggesting interdependencies across multiple weak topics, not just isolated concept maps.
- Topic Exploration (RAG Support):
    - LLMs summarized and contextualized top web search results retrieved via SerpAPI, providing real-time, dynamic topic content.
- Chat Assistant:
    - Handled free-form natural language questions related to course material, homework, or general educational guidance.

---

## Challenges Encountered

- LLM output varied slightly even with the same prompts, causing occasional mismatches in quiz difficulty or graph structure.
- Frequent GPT API calls (especially for quizzes and graph generation) increased latency and API cost.
- LLM-based results tied closely to user progress needed to persist across Streamlit sessions, which reset easily.
- Combining live web search + GPT summarization added noticeable delay during topic exploration.

---

## Future Improvements

- Integrate spaced repetition for quiz questions.
- Add role-based dashboards for students and teachers.
- Enable saving and downloading of personalized learning reports.
- Add multi-language support.
